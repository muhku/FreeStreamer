[![BuddyBuild](https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/api/statusImage?appID=562ad6e924925601002113d5&branch=master&build=latest)](https://dashboard.buddybuild.com/apps/562ad6e924925601002113d5/build/latest)

A streaming audio player for iOS and OS X.

Features
====================

- **CPU-friendly** design (uses 1% of CPU on average when streaming)
- **Multiple protocols supported**: ShoutCast, standard HTTP, local files
- **Prepared for tough network conditions**: adjustable buffer sizes, stream pre-buffering and restart on failures
- **Metadata support**: ShoutCast metadata, IDv2 tags
- **Local disk caching**: user only needs to stream a file once and after that it can be played from a local cache
- **Preloading**: playback can start immediately without needing to wait for buffering
- **Record**: support recording the stream contents to a file
- **Access the PCM audio samples**: as an example, a visualizer is included
